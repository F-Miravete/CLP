REQP-1839#1 Warning
RAMB36 async control check  
The RAMB36E1 waveGenerator_inst/rom/o_cos_reg_0 has an input control pin waveGenerator_inst/rom/o_cos_reg_0/ADDRARDADDR[10] (net: waveGenerator_inst/rom/nco_out_reg_rep[11]__0[7]) which is driven by a register (waveGenerator_inst/nco_out_reg_rep[7]__0) that has an active asychronous set or reset. This may cause corruption of the memory contents and/or read values when the set/reset is asserted and is not analyzed by the default static timing analysis. It is suggested to eliminate the use of a set/reset to registers driving this RAMB pin or else use a synchronous reset in which the assertion of the reset is timed by default.

The RAMB18E1 waveGenerator_inst/rom/o_sin_reg_1 has an input control pin waveGenerator_inst/rom/o_sin_reg_1/ADDRARDADDR[12] (net: waveGenerator_inst/rom/Q[10]) which is driven by a register (waveGenerator_inst/nco_out_reg_rep[10]) that has an active asychronous set or reset. This may cause corruption of the memory contents and/or read values when the set/reset is asserted and is not analyzed by the default static timing analysis. It is suggested to eliminate the use of a set/reset to registers driving this RAMB pin or else use a synchronous reset in which the assertion of the reset is timed by default.
